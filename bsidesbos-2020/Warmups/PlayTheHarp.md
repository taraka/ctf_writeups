## Play the Harp

On this challenge we're given an image, if you run strings on the image

`strings -n 8 harp.jpg | less`

we can see that there is some unnusual blocks of text that are 8 bytes long, in the first instance I didn't spot the flag but it was vertical in the final column of the text. If you can't spot it look for the {}'s'
